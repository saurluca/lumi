# Lumi App - Making Household Chores Fun and Collaborative


## Project Description

Lumi is an innovative mobile application designed to make household chores easier, more rewarding, and even fun! Our vision is to transform the often-tedious task of keeping your home clean and organized into a collaborative and engaging experience.

We achieve this by **framing chores as a story, a story of preparing and launching a rocket.** This narrative approach aims to inject excitement and a sense of progress into everyday household tasks. By making household work more fun and collaborative, while maintaining a flexible plan, Lumi helps individuals and families stay on top of their chores without feeling overwhelmed or bored.

    * Setting schedules and due dates.
    * Assigning tasks to different users (within a household).
    * Tracking task completion.

    * Ability to create household groups and invite family members or roommates.
    * Shared visibility of group tasks and progress.
* **Personalized Rocket (Visual Metaphor):**
    * A visual representation of a rocket that progresses towards launch as tasks are completed.
    * Personalized view of individual progress contributing to the overall "rocket launch."
* **Personal/Group View (Toggle):**
    * Users can switch between viewing their individual tasks and the overall progress of the household group.
* **Basic Rocket Theme:**
    * Initial design and visual elements centered around the rocket launch theme.


## Why Lumi?

We believe Lumi offers a fresh and engaging approach to household management. By leveraging the power of storytelling, collaboration, and positive reinforcement, we aim to:

* Reduce the feeling of burden associated with chores.
* Encourage greater participation from all household members.
* Foster a sense of accomplishment and teamwork.
* Ultimately, create cleaner and more organized homes with less stress and more fun.
